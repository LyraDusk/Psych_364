# Measures:

#  Preliminary Analyses:
Include a section called Demographics or Participants or
Participant Demographics or Preliminary Analyses. This is either a subsection of the
Method section, or the Results section, depending on how involved it gets. You can be
creative in this section, but here are some suggested things to include:
o Describe any exclusion criteria used: for the first question we are exluding lesbain couples.
those would din't answer all of the questions NA values for important questions for analysis 

o Report sample size (number of individuals as well as number of dyads).
o Demographics for the sample. That is, percentages of gender,
percentages of racial groups, participant age, major, income, age of children,
adoption type:

o If working with indistinguishable dyads same-gender and different-gender couples:

o If working with distinguishable dyads, report the correlations among important
study variables using the dyad dataset. I recommend doing this in a table, NOT by
reporting each correlation in the text:

o If working with distinguishable dyads, you can run some paired-samples t-tests
using the dyad dataset to test for basic differences:

o If working with all the same-gender couples in Goldberg, you can do some
independent samples t-tests to examine differences in between-dyads variables
(e.g., is relationship length different between Lesbian and Gay male couples?). To
do this, using the individual or pairwise data, you will need to first filter for
member 1 so thereâ€™s only one record per couple. Then you can do your t-test.
